# Personalized Wordlists
***
### In order to create a personalized wordlist for a user, we need to collect information about that user 

### Mangling
#### There remains the possibility of generating numerous variations for each word in the list. Since we can never fully anticipate how our target constructs their password, it is prudent to include as many modifications and combinations as possible. Naturally, this approach will significantly extend the time required to brute-force the password.
#### Fortunately, there are excellent tools available that can efficiently handle word manipulation and case variation, such as [rsmangler](https://github.com/digininja/RSMangler) or [The Mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist.git). These tools offer a wide range of options, enabling even a modest wordlist to expand into millions of possible combinations. It's important to keep these tools in mind, as they may prove invaluable in other scenarios and modules.



### Custom Username Wordlist
#### To create a list of potential usernames we can just write it manually or use a tool. For example the [Username Anarchy tool](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy)
